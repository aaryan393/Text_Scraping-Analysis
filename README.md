## Introduction

Text Scraping using Beautiful Soup and Analysis is a project that demonstrates how to extract text data from web pages using Beautiful Soup, a popular Python library for web scraping. The collected text data is then subjected to various analysis techniques to derive meaningful insights and patterns.

## Features

- Web scraping using Beautiful Soup to extract text from web pages.
- Preprocessing the scraped text data.
- Performing analysis such as sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and topic modeling.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Beautiful Soup 4
- Requests
- Pandas
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aaryan393/text_scraping-analysis.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd text-scraping-analysis
    ```

3. Install the required packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the scraping script to extract text from web pages and store it in a file:

    ```bash
    python text_scraping.ipynb
    ```

2. Run the analysis script to process the scraped text and perform analysis:

    ```bash
    python Text_analysis.ipynb
    ```


## Examples

### Scraping Text

- The `text_scraping.ipynb` script scrapes text from specified URLs using Beautiful Soup and saves the extracted text to a file.

### Analyzing Text

- The `Text_analysis.ipynb` script processes the scraped text, cleaning, performs analysis, and  based on the extracted data.
